                    UCCE is trying to engage the community of Santa Clara County. Website users (Residents in Santa Clara County) need 
                    more meaningful representation of the data and they need a better criteria of how to track the amount they are composting. 
                    With the current itteration of the calculator, CO2 calculations given without context, making them less meaningful. Additionally
                    UCCE provides surveys to composting workshop participants to see their progress and many people misrepresenting the amount they compost, which in turn
                    skews the data that the UCCE collects.

                    Hi, welcome to my Efolio!
                    <br> <br>
                    This website serves as a place for me to document my progression through my project for ENGR110. 
                    Myself, along with my three teammates (click <a href = "TeamPage.html">here</a> to meet my team) are in partnership with UCCE Composting Education Program. We were tasked 
                    improve upon a previous itteration of a Data Analysis Tool for the UCCE CEP. This tool allows more community engagation in UCCE's mission to educated Santa Clara County on the effects of 
                    composting and allows people to be more aware of their enviorment.
