            <h1>Week 10</h1>
            <p>
            During Week 10, we were finishing up all the small details that we needed to complete prior to sending Victoria all the information adn develeriables. This mostly consisted of making sure permissions for all the different documents were granted to Victoria, or ownership was transfered.
            This included the google form, google sheets, and git hub repository. Additionally we had to finish our final report to turn into Dr. JAK. Taking into consideration Aly's comments, we revised our Final Report Draft. In this version we cleaned up the bullet points into paragraph form, inserting images, and added
            neccesary citations for our in text references. We also delievered a google doc to Victoria maintaing links to all the deliverables she needs. This includes a link to the site that needs to be embedded on UCCE's end, a link to the github hosting the calculator, the google form she needs to fill in the future, and the google sheet
            that contains the data. She has access and ownership for all of these delieverables making for a smooth transition between a SCU project and a UCCE webstie component.
            <br><br>
            </p>

            <h1>Week 9</h1>
            <p>
            During Week 9, I figured out how to implement a live data feature on the website using Google slides and Google forms. Using the previous team's API key, I made a public google sheets which allows the API to retrieve 8 data points from the cells.
            From there, my code inputs this data into two graphs. One graph represents the food waste composted by survey participants, and I also have a bar graph that displays the yard composting values. The way that the survery data is gather is in options rather than inputed responses. 
            For example, a user for food waste as the option responding with 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 gallons, but they are not allowed to input custom values like 3.2 gallons. A UCCE CEP employee would simply use EXCEL commands to count the occurances for each value
            and input this to the google form. Once the site is reloaded after the new submission is processed, the live data will be updated onto the website. 
            Additionally I created a guide to help victoria accurately and consistently gather these value counts. There are some conversions from strings to integers with this process and negating some values that we are not able to access, thus with my guide she would know what to do when 
            unusual occurances happen. 
            <br><br> 

            Finally we uploaded all the code to the github and now we have a perfectly working link! Here is the link! https://amangalick.github.io/src/pages/home.html

            <h1>Week 8</h1>
            <p>
            During Week 8, I was tasked to create the google form and google sheet that our javascript would pull from. I was able to sucesfully link the google form, but unfornatuely I don't believe that we will be using this new form.
            The original idea was that Victoria would download their data into a EXCEL sheet and use EXCEL commands to get means, standard deviations, and summations of each composting type (Food, Yard, and Combined Waste). This would then be 
            displayed on our website and my idea was that there is enough data to represent this in a normal distribution graph. This would also give us rough estimates of percentiles which would be calculated and inform the user on how well they composted compared t
            to the Qualtrics data base. Unfortunately as I was looking at the data that Victoria pulled from the Qualtrics data base, it seems like their data is sparse and the format of the answers were "Option 1: 10 gallons". This eliminates the option of having Victoria 
            use EXCEL commands and would require her to manually calculate the mean, sum, and standard deviation of all three categories. This is definately not ideal since this should not be strenious on Victoria. Thus, all my contributions for week 8 will not be displayed on the website.

            <br><br>

            I also started working on the Final Draft with the team. I started inputting my sources into the document as well as inserting the images that I created on figma for the website. Additionally I formatted the paper so it would resemble the final paper as much as possible 
            so that we would have to do less work going forward on the actual Final Paper.

            <br><br>

            <h1>Week 7</h1>
            <p>
            During week 7, we had our Update Presentation to Victoria. After the presentation, she expressed to us that she liked the direction of our project, but she did give us one critique. The comment was that our project
            should be less focused on comparing users data with their database and more focused on contextulizing the data that we are presenting them. She also mentioned that she would love for us to 
            include some sort of time metric into the data, which I think if we have time, we could implement with some sort of end of year projection. 

            <br><br> 

            For the rest of the week, my focus was on implementing the animations that we wanted to incorporated onto the website. These applied to two components, the moving car as well as the moving battery. For the moving car, 
            this was implemented by using an image of a car and having it move within the box that it is assinged to. For this I looked up the process on youtube and adjusted it to fit our specific project and website specifications.
            For the moving battery, I created 5 different stages of the battery charging on figma and essentailly created a slideshow of the 5 images that make it appear that only the battery is moving. For this youtube and chatgpt were helpful
            to find the bugs and specify it to our implementation. 

            <br><br>

            I also wanted to fix a couple of bugs that appear while testing the website. Initally the popup display window showed up on top of the website without any overlay to cover the main webiste. This made it difficult to focus on the popup display, so I fixed that bug. 
            I also tested our website on different display sizes including mobile, tablet, and standard desktop and found that while the site is compatible with different sizes, the layout had to be changed when we went on smaller screens. For this I added break points for visual displays that 
            had the different boxes all structured vertically on top of each other rather than havign some horizontally stacked.

            <h1>Week 6</h1>
            <p>
                Week 6's work surrounded implementing our design within the javascript file. I took adjusting the calculation conversion boxes while my partner Ron added pop up windows
                to each component. For right now the conversions are inaccurate as we only wanted to focus on layout this week. Hopefully next week we will be able to use the correct formulas.
                I created new functions that created more a more interesting layout such as createThreeStatContainer and createVerticleContainer which allows for three containres to be displayed with two collums, one collum has two containers stacked on top of each other and 
                the other container is double the size. As of right now I have static images as a place holder for the moving visuals that we plan on implementing in the future. 
                <br><br>
                In terms of having real time data displayed on the website, our previous pitch of having Patrick create a Qualtrics script is not realistic in terms of 
                security issues. Patrick is a volunteer at CEP, not an employee, which means that he would also not be granted access to create a script that pulls data from their data base. A new idea that we 
                are looking into involves getting data from Santa Clara University's Sustainability Center. Dr. JAK proposed this idea as we could potentially have access given we are SCU students.

            <h1>Week 5</h1>
            <p>
                During Week 5, our team met up with Patrick who is a volunteer at the Composting Education Program. Patrick has previous expereince in software with 
                five years of industry expereince. In order to have real time data displayed within the calculator, we would need access to the Qualtrics survey data. This brought up
                a previous issue that the last team had. In order to get around this, Dr. JAK suggested that we devise a way to have Patrick develop the Qualtrics script then with the neccesary data, we have him enter the
                statistics into a googel form. She suggested that we pitch this idea to CEP with a black box schematic, which I created on Figma. Additionally, I wrote up on a Google Doc all the things we would need from them
                going forward to give them more structure in what to for the rest of the quarter.
                <br><br>
                I also took the time this week to edit the current web application on my local browser. Here I found a way to alter the current layout of the containers, and change the data displayed. My goal for this week is the lay out the 
                boxes in the manner desired then add in the data later as those will be quick adjustments to the website. I also drew up what I think the new site should look like. I've attached the image below. Also the layout
                is still very similar to the previous design, our new design will have new visuals and less symmetry, which make for more intresting layout of the data for the users.

            <h1>Week 4</h1>
            <p>
                During Week 4, our team solidified our plans for the rest of the quarter. On Tuesday, January 30, 2023, we held a zoom meeting with Victoria and
                presented a slide show of the problems we saw in the previous design and what our solution was. We pinpointed two main issues which included creating
                more meaningful representation of the data displayed and an additional HTML page that helped composters a more accurate template on how to track accurately. 
                For this meeting, I created a Google Slides presentation that included the problem statement, our solution, and examples of what those solutions might look like. 
                Once Victoria approved of our ideas, we were able to seperate into two groups.

                <br><br>
                I came into this class to challenge my technical abilities and expand my skillsets, so I wanted to be in the team that worked on the 
                meaninful representation. This portion of our design will require more technical research and thus requiring to have a full understanding of the previous
                team's Github repository. After teams were made, Ron and I created an outline of the major parts of the project which included deadlines, descriptions, and 
                team leads.
                
                <br><br>
                Throughout the rest of week 4, Ron and I were tasked to become familiar with the javascript code, that handled displaying customized
                information and visuals. With the help of chatGPT, I was able to take down notes on the Javascript file on Notion, that helped me organize my notes and reference the orginial code.
                Although I have a much better understanding of the code once breaking it down on my own, we still wanted to employ the help of the previous team members. Thus, Maya contacted Stevie Dean,
                an SCU student that worked on the first iteration, and I sent a follow up email with concrete dates and finally sent a final Zoom meeting with him and the team.

                <br><br>

                On Sunday, Feburary 4th, our team set up a meeting with Stevie going over the techincal background of their implementation of the tool. We discussed transfering permission from the previous owners
                to our team in terms of the Google Spreadsheet, Qualtrics Script and the Github Repository. We also went over his experience with working with the tool and requested advice on how to proceed for our project.
                He informed us that we had to contact previous team members to get the permission and I emailed another SCU student that had access to the Qualtrics Script.

            <h1>Week 3</h1>
            <p>
                Week 3 mainly consisted of the team getting a better understanding of the project and which aspects of last quarter's
                project we wanted to tackle. Part of this process was setting up an interview with our main point of contact, Victoria.
                The Sunday prior to the interview, we sat down and dicussed what questions we wanted to ask her and ranking them based off
                of priority as we only had a 30 minute time slot.

                <br><br>
                During the actual meeting, my role was to ask Victoria the questions. We were able to ask most of our questions in full, gaining
                a better understanding for what the goals and aspirations that UCCE CEP had for this quarter. At the end of the meeting, we agreed to
                meet with Victoria once a week to ask questions or update on our progress. For both the inital meeting and the recurring meetings, I set
                up the zoom link and sent out a google calendar invite.

                <br><br>
                During the weekend after Week 3, I looked into the previous team's github, to try to understand their implementations. This 
                provided me an idea of the scope of the project and how high we should aim for the rest of the quarter. After considering Victoria's wants
                and with a better understanding of the difficulty of the project, I pitched to the team that we should focus on two aspects for the quarter.
                The first is to implement meaningful results as the current results from the calculator are a little difficult to understand and don't 
                make much of an impact. The second is to provide a secondary page on how to accurately track how much one composts. These are two 
                needs that Victoria pointed out in the meeting and I believe that we can accomplish this within the alloted timeframe.
