            <h1>Week 4</h1>
            <p>
                During Week 4, our team solidified our plans for the rest of the quarter. On Tuesday, January 30, 2023, we held a zoom meeting with Victoria and
                presented a slide show of the problems we saw in the previous design and what our solution was. We pinpointed two main issues which included creating
                more meaningful representation of the data displayed and an additional HTML page that helped composters a more accurate template on how to track accurately. 
                For this meeting, I created a Google Slides presentation that included the problem statement, our solution, and examples of what those solutions might look like. 
                Once Victoria approved of our ideas, we were able to seperate into two groups.

                <br><br>
                I came into this class to challenge my technical abilities and expand my skillsets, so I wanted to be in the team that worked on the 
                meaninful representation. This portion of our design will require more technical research and thus requiring to have a full understanding of the previous
                team's Github repository. After teams were made, Ron and I created an outline of the major parts of the project which included deadlines, descriptions, and 
                team leads.
                
                <br><br>
                Throughout the rest of week 4, Ron and I were tasked to become familiar with the javascript code, that handled displaying customized
                information and visuals. With the help of chatGPT, I was able to take down notes on the Javascript file on Notion, that helped me organize my notes and reference the orginial code.
                Although I have a much better understanding of the code once breaking it down on my own, we still wanted to employ the help of the previous team members. Thus, Maya contacted Stevie Dean,
                an SCU student that worked on the first iteration, and I sent a follow up email with concrete dates and finally sent a final Zoom meeting with him and the team.

                <br><br>

                On Sunday, Feburary 4th, our team set up a meeting with Stevie going over the techincal background of their implementation of the tool. We discussed transfering permission from the previous owners
                to our team in terms of the Google Spreadsheet, Qualtrics Script and the Github Repository. We also went over his experience with working with the tool and requested advice on how to proceed for our project.
                He informed us that we had to contact previous team members to get the permission and I emailed another SCU student that had access to the Qualtrics Script.

            <h1>Week 3</h1>
            <p>
                Week 3 mainly consisted of the team getting a better understanding of the project and which aspects of last quarter's
                project we wanted to tackle. Part of this process was setting up an interview with our main point of contact, Victoria.
                The Sunday prior to the interview, we sat down and dicussed what questions we wanted to ask her and ranking them based off
                of priority as we only had a 30 minute time slot.

                <br><br>
                During the actual meeting, my role was to ask Victoria the questions. We were able to ask most of our questions in full, gaining
                a better understanding for what the goals and aspirations that UCCE CEP had for this quarter. At the end of the meeting, we agreed to
                meet with Victoria once a week to ask questions or update on our progress. For both the inital meeting and the recurring meetings, I set
                up the zoom link and sent out a google calendar invite.

                <br><br>
                During the weekend after Week 3, I looked into the previous team's github, to try to understand their implementations. This 
                provided me an idea of the scope of the project and how high we should aim for the rest of the quarter. After considering Victoria's wants
                and with a better understanding of the difficulty of the project, I pitched to the team that we should focus on two aspects for the quarter.
                The first is to implement meaningful results as the current results from the calculator are a little difficult to understand and don't 
                make much of an impact. The second is to provide a secondary page on how to accurately track how much one composts. These are two 
                needs that Victoria pointed out in the meeting and I believe that we can accomplish this within the alloted timeframe.
